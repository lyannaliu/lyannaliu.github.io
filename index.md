# CS109A Data Science Final Project


## Motivation

（Modifications are more than welcomed!）
Music Recommender System (MRS) have recently exploded popularity thanks to music streaming services like Spotify. By some accounts, almost half of all current music consumption is by the way of these services. Thus, a good music recommender system can bring considerable profits to streaming services, especially for those which has large amount of users like Spotify. 

Spotify provides access to more than 35 million songs, it has 170 million monthly active users, including 75 million paying subscribers. Although it already has decent music recommending services such as Discover Weekly, it’s algorithms could still stand improvement. For example, there are complaints on Spotify not separating brands/performers that sharing the same name well enough. Also, Spotify sometimes recommends songs to users based on their locations, which is not welcomed all the time. We (I personally) think it would be preferred to simply recommend songs based on playlist. The goal of our project is, given a song, predict what songs a user will like by comparing it to playlist.
